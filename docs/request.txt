I want to create uploader for files and automatically upload them to AWS S3 bucket.

I need to create serverless in python using aws serverless, using api gateway, dynamodb and lambda.

I need a simple html file to test this. Apart from the file itself, I need to entry the text in the form. The text also will be save to dynamodb. And the S3 bucket filename will also write in the dynamodb.

If somebody upload the file, there will be triggered a lmbda function with the input of the dynamodb id. The lambda function will print the id to the console.

I need to create:

1. HTML test file for upload and data entry
2. Serverless function for dynamodb and lambda
3. Api gateway for the serverless upload

Let me also what to do in aws console, what information needed.
And what to do with serverless framework
